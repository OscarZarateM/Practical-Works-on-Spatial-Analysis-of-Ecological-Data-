## 1. Read data

-   ***Add Delimited Text Layer***:"punktid.csv"

-   ***Add Vector Layer*** "soomaa.shp"

-   ***Add Raster Layer*** "korgusraster.tif\*

## 2. Check Data and metadata of layers

-   Check layer ***Properties*** (CRS)

-   Check ***Attribute Table*** (Columns, values)

## 3. Reproject layers

-   Set all layers to the same CRS (EPSG: 3301), use ***Reproject***, ***Warp***

-   Save reprojected layers

## 4. Change symbology

Change the symbology of the layers:

-   Points should represent the Esri_label

-   Use a proper color ramp for the elevation raster

## 5. Use ***Join Attributes by Location*** to find which Points are inside the soomaa vector

## 6. Use ***Extract by Attribute*** to filter the points with "Crops" in the column "Esri_label"

## 7. Using the selected "Crops" points, create a ***Buffer*** of 10km around them

## 8. Use ***Intersection*** to see if any of the created Buffers intersects with the Soommaa layer. How large is the area? (***Field Calculator***)

## 9. Crop/***Mask*** the elevation raster with the soomma vector layer

## 10. Raster

-   Use ***Raster layer statistics*** to get a basic summary of the clipped Raster

-   Use ***Reclassify by Table*** to create a new elevation (eesti.korgu)raster. Values \<20 should be change to 0, values \>= 20 should change to 20

        OR

-   Change the symbology of the elevation raster (eesti.korgu) so values \>20 are in one color and values \>= have another color

## 11. Map design

-   Recreate the map #3 and map #5 of the R task (m3, m5)

-   For map #3 change the symbology of the points so they represent the Corine_label

-   A proper map for a cartographer should include a Title, North Arrow, a Scale Bar, and informative legends of what is represented.

-   You can add a nice background layer. You can use the next steps for it (thanks to ["Klas Karlsson"](https://github.com/klakar):

    a)  Open the link and copy the script from GitHub [`link`](https://github.com/klakar/QGIS_resources/blob/master/collections/Geosupportsystem/python/qgis_basemaps.py)
    b)  In QGIS open the ***Python Console*** on the toolbar. Paste the script on the console and click Enter
    c)  Close the python console
    d)  On the Browser Panel, on the XYZ tiles section you should see now a set of layers. You can use this as Base maps (Figure 1)
    e)  An alternative is to use a WMS from the ["Estonian Land Board"](https://geoportaal.maaamet.ee/eng/Services/Public-WMS-WFS-p346.html)
